## 🎧 DK Music Player & 🧮 Calculator

These Python GUI projects were developed during my **virtual internship at CodeClause**. Both applications are built using the **Tkinter** library, offering interactive user interfaces — a music player for playing `.mp3` and `.flac` files, and a calculator that performs standard arithmetic operations with a modern button design.
